# centernet_tensorflow_wilderface_voc
### 1.Introduction
This is the unofficial  implementation of the "CenterNet:Objects as Points".In my experiment, it was not based on the DLA34, Hourglass and other networks in the original paper. I simply modified shufflenetv2_1.0x and yolov3, and kept their feature extraction part, then connected to centernet_detect_head, and did not use dcn convolution.
<br>This is just a simple attempt to the effect of the algorithm.
<br>Official implementation:<https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet>
<br>Corresponding paper:<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07850.pdf>
<br>Shufflenetv2 is modified from:<https://github.com/timctho/shufflenet-v2-tensorflow>
<br>Yolov3 is is modified from:<https://github.com/wizyoung/YOLOv3_TensorFlow>
